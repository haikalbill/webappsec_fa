## <a name="int"/> Introduction
<br>
In our Web Application Security group project, we are tasked with enhancing our previous web application, developed during the Web Technologies course (INFO 2302), by incorporating comprehensive security measures. This involves applying all the security elements and components we've learned in class to ensure the web application is fortified against potential vulnerabilities. Our enhanced web application will demonstrate robust security practices, addressing the most critical aspects of web security. The culmination of this project will be a presentation of the secured web application during the examination week, showcasing our efforts in making the application resilient and secure.

## <a name="obj"/>Objective
<br>
The objective of this Web Application Security group project is to enhance the previously developed web application from the Web Technologies course (INFO 2302) by integrating comprehensive security measures. This involves implementing key security elements such as input validation, authentication, authorization, XSS and CSRF prevention, and enforcing database and file security. The goal is to ensure that the web application provides a secure service to its users, is resilient against common vulnerabilities, and remains available when needed. The project aims to demonstrate our ability to apply learned security principles and techniques to create a robust and secure web application

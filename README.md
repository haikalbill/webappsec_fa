## <a name="web"/>Web Application Security Enhancements:

### <a name="inp"/> 1.Input Validation
1. For login.php and LoginProcess.php
- Client-Side Validation
Username Validation:
Implementation: The username field is validated to only allow alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) using the regex /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.

Password Validation:
Length Check: The password must be at least 8 characters long
Uppercase Check: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter, enforced using the regex /[A-Z]/.
Alphanumeric Check: The password must be alphanumeric, ensuring it contains only letters and numbers, using the regex /[a-zA-Z0-9]/.

Server-Side Validation
SQL Injection Prevention
Implementation: The username is sanitized using real_escape_string before it is used in the SQL query.
Password Verification
Implementation: The submitted password is checked against the hashed password stored in the database using password_verify
Session Fixation Prevention:
Implementation: session_regenerate_id(true) is called after a successful login.

for Signup.php and SignupProcess.php

Client-Side Validation:
HTML5 Validation: Uses the required attribute to ensure fields are not empty.
JavaScript Validation:
Username Validation:
The username is validated to ensure it contains only alphanumeric characters using the regex /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.
Password Validation:
The password is validated to ensure it is at least 8 characters long.
It must contain at least one uppercase letter, validated using the regex /[A-Z]/.
It must be alphanumeric, validated using the regex /[a-zA-Z0-9]/.

Server-Side Validation:
Sanitization: Uses htmlspecialchars and trim to sanitize inputs, preventing XSS attacks.
Validation:
Username: Ensures it is alphanumeric.
Password: 
Check for uppercase letter:
preg_match('/[A-Z]/', $password): This checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
Check for alphanumeric:
preg_match('/[a-zA-Z0-9]/', $password): This ensures that the password contains only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).
Password Hashing: Hashes the password using password_hash with the PASSWORD_BCRYPT algorithm.
Database Check: Checks if the username already exists in the database to prevent duplicates.

### <a name="authe"/> 2. Authentication

1. Added a login and signup page where username and password need to be enter.

2. Securing Password-Based Authentication
- The password complexity are set Numbers + Lowercase Letters + Uppercase letters + at least 8 characters by using regex
````
          var usernameRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/;
          if (!usernameRegex.test(username)) {
            alert('Username can only contain letters and numbers.');
            return false;
          }

          if (password.length < 8) {
            alert('Password must be at least 8 characters long.');
            return false;
          }

          var uppercaseRegex = /[A-Z]/;
          if (!uppercaseRegex.test(password)) {
            alert('Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.');
            return false;
          }

          var lowercaseRegex = /[a-z]/;
          if (!lowercaseRegex.test(password)) {
            alert('Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.');
            return false;
          }

          var numberRegex = /[0-9]/;
          if (!numberRegex.test(password)) {
            alert('Password must contain at least one number.');
            return false;
          }

          var alphanumericRegex = /[a-zA-Z0-9]/;
          if (!alphanumericRegex.test(password)) {
            alert('Password must be alphanumeric.');
            return false;
          }
````
- Properly store passwords by using hashing algorithm
````
// Hash the password
$hashedPassword = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
````

3. Allow account lockout (prevent brute-force attack)
- Allow account to be lockout for 15 minutes if failed attempt more than 5 times and timeframe are recorded in the database.  
````
// Check if the account is locked
    $lockout_duration = 15 * 60; // 15 minutes in seconds
    $current_time = time();
    $last_failed_attempt = strtotime($row['last_failed_attempt']);
    $failed_attempts = $row['failed_attempts'];

    if ($failed_attempts >= 5 && ($current_time - $last_failed_attempt) < $lockout_duration) {
        echo "<script>alert('Account is locked. Please try again after 15 minutes.'); window.location.href='login.php';</script>";
        exit;
    } elseif (($current_time - $last_failed_attempt) >= $lockout_duration) {
        // Reset failed attempts after lockout duration
        $failed_attempts = 0;
        $sql = "UPDATE users SET failed_attempts = 0, last_failed_attempt = NULL WHERE username='$username'";
        $conn->query($sql);
    }
    if (password_verify($password, $row['password'])) {
        // Reset failed attempts on successful login
        $sql = "UPDATE users SET failed_attempts = 0, last_failed_attempt = NULL WHERE username='$username'";
        $conn->query($sql);
        ...
        // Update failed attempts count and timestamp
        $failed_attempts++;
        $sql = "UPDATE users SET failed_attempts = $failed_attempts, last_failed_attempt = NOW() WHERE username='$username'";
        $conn->query($sql);
````

### <a name="autho"/> 3. Authorization
1. Add a admin user where it can see the booking records and delete data.
````
// Redirect to Index.php or admin.php based on user role
         // Check if the user is Admin123
        if ($username === 'Admin123') {
            $_SESSION['admin_loggedin'] = true;
            header("Location: admin.php");
            exit;
        } else {
            // Redirect to Index.php for regular users
            header("Location: Index.php");
            exit;
        }
````

2. Regenerating Session IDs on Authentication
````
session_regenerate_id(true);
````
  
3. Enforcing Idle Session Timeout
````
$inactive = 1800; // 30 minutes in seconds
if (isset($_SESSION['last_activity']) && (time() - $_SESSION['last_activity'] > $inactive)) {
    session_unset(); // unset $_SESSION variable for the run-time
    session_destroy(); // destroy session data in storage
    header("Location: login.php"); // Redirect to login page
    exit;
}
$_SESSION['last_activity'] = time(); // Update last activity time stamp
````

4. Enforcing Absolute Session Timeout
````
$session_lifetime = 3600; // 1 hour in seconds
if (isset($_SESSION['created']) && (time() - $_SESSION['created'] > $session_lifetime)) {
    session_unset(); // unset $_SESSION variable for the run-time
    session_destroy(); // destroy session data in storage
    header("Location: login.php"); // Redirect to login page
    exit;
}
$_SESSION['created'] = time(); // Set session creation time
````

### <a name="xss"/> 4. XSS and CSRF Prevention (Haikal)

1. CSP Header: The script correctly sets a Content Security Policy header, which is a good practice for mitigating some types of XSS attacks by preventing the browser from loading malicious scripts from unauthorized sources.

CSRF Protection:
CSRF Token Generation: The code generates a CSRF token using bin2hex(random_bytes(32)) and stores it in the user's session with $_SESSION['csrf_token'] = $token;. This token should be included in forms as a hidden input and verified on form submission to protect against CSRF attacks.

2. Sanitization of Input: The function sanitizeInput() uses htmlspecialchars() and trim() to sanitize user inputs, which is a common defense against XSS attacks. This function is applied to the $name and $message variables after they are received from the POST request, ensuring that any HTML special characters are converted to their corresponding HTML entities. This prevents malicious scripts from being executed in the browser.

### <a name="data"/> 5. Database Security Principles (Haikal)

1. SQL Injection Prevention: The code uses $conn->real_escape_string($username) to escape special characters in the $username variable before it is used in the SQL query. This is a basic measure against SQL injection attacks.

- ![image](https://github.com/haikalbill/webappsec_fa/assets/90669152/fb217c25-27c3-4ed2-9f7d-46e4e2ac9989)

2. Password Hashing Verification: It uses password_verify($password, $row['password']) to check the password. This function is secure for verifying hashed passwords, indicating that passwords are not stored in plain text in the database.

3. Error Handling: Where a more secure approach is to handle errors without revealing details about the system or database structure to the end-user.

### <a name="fil"/> 6. File Security Principles (Haikal)
1. SSL Certificate & HTTPS: Use a HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server, protecting the data from being intercepted or tampered with.
